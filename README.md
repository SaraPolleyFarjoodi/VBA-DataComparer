# VBA-DataComparer
Automated a program in VBA to compare trades between three different spread sheets.

This program was made during an internship for the purpose of speeding up the process of ensuring all trades matched up across all platforms we would receive them on before they'd be inputted. This was especially helpful when there were 100-150 trades to check in the morning. Instead of checking them manually, they could be checked with the press of a couple buttons. Please note that the two example trades are made up and do not use any private information.

The program requires you to paste the values into the indicated columns (as stated in the instructions on the first excel sheet). This was done to allow anyone on the team to use it as a tool, but it not be something that the team would have to maintain, update, and manage once I left my internship with them.
